# Raylib.js

Unofficial Implementation of Subset of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) API in JavaScript so you can use it from WebAssembly. Intended as a simplier Web version of Raylib that does not require Emscripten.

**WARNING! This is a Research Project and not guaranteed to be useful in present or/and future! If you quickly need to port your Raylib game to Web just follow these instructions: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-for-Web-(HTML5)**

## Main Idea

The main idea is to enable a very specific style of [Programming in C for WebAssembly without Emscripten](https://surma.dev/things/c-to-webassembly/) but for Raylib. The current limitation is that Raylib.js is not fully implemented, but it does not mean it is useless! If you have a Game that uses only implemented function you can use Raylib.js. And if only few needed functions are not implemented you can implement them and submit a PR thus improving the library for future uses.

We have no plans to replace the official Emscripten version of Raylib. This is a Reasearch Project intended to explore how far this approach can be pushed.

## Start Demo Locally

The demo is deployed to GitHub pages: https://tsoding.github.io/raylib.js/ But you can run it locally.

```console
$ python3 -m http.server 6969
$ <browser> http://localhost:6969/
```

## Build Demos

```console
$ clang -o nob nob.c
$ ./nob
```
